# First Repo 

This is my first repository on GitHub.  
It contains a simple Python program as a starting point to learn Git, GitHub, and version control basics.  

## Features
- Beginner-friendly Python script (`main.py`)
- Demonstrates commits, pushing, and repo setup
- Acts as a foundation for future projects

## Run
```bash
python main.py
